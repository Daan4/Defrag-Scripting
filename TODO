ideas: ultimate hodor bot
       parameter optimizing strafebot

easier way to timer / wait on script finish
add target speed / target params to be checked from ps
ie walk to 320ups

allow turning while walking for example,
maybe split up cjturn into viewturn and cj presses

auto copy over python files, including a folder structure

fix importing scripts_record_playback, crashes q3

automate load / deployment / launch engine

record inputs from demoes for playback -> look into saving / writing playerstate in snapshot / clientsnapshot

make usercmd record and replay work with delta angles

some maffs https://dimit.me/blog/2017/08/08/defrag-strafe-theory/

add some stuff to usercmd_t to automatically addding/subbing ps.delta_angles when reading/writing cmd.angles

somehow allow kwargs in do()

why does startangle need -90? Maybe implementation of angle helpers is wrong ,see xpc's one which is apparently from c code

make it so that started scripts run immediately (eg if created in CL_CreateCmd, also run the started script's CL_CreateCmd (if they are defined earlier they will only get called 1 frame later)
