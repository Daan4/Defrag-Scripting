demo list in ui is empty (playing and recording demoes works tho) seems like this iodfengine version is just crap

add custom cvar to exec scripts /execscript or smt

idea: ultimate hodor bot

automate load / deployment / launch engine

figure out how to do hotswapping python code without restarting engine

better debugging tools for python code -> for starter try catch entire program and write most detailed stacktrace to error.log

record inputs from demoes for playback -> look into saving / writing playerstate in snapshot / clientsnapshot

if it fails to randomly compile -> probably wrong file endings

fix makefile:
    sdl264.dll does not get copied automatically anymore?
    sync entire python folder automatically to a subfolder like /build/python
