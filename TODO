demo list in ui is empty (playing and recording demoes works tho) seems like this iodfengine version is just crap

rewrite makefile to copy entire python folder to build folder instead of hardcoding each file

add custom cvar to exec scripts /execscript or smt

idea: ultimate hodor bot

automate load / deployment / launch engine

figure out how to do hotswapping python code without restarting engine

better debugging tools for python code

record inputs from demoes for playback
