demo list in ui is empty (playing and recording demoes works tho) seems like this iodfengine version is just crap

idea: ultimate hodor bot

automate load / deployment / launch engine

figure out how to do hotswapping python code without restarting engine

record inputs from demoes for playback -> look into saving / writing playerstate in snapshot / clientsnapshot

makefile fixes
    sdl264.dll does not get copied automatically anymore?
    sync entire python folder automatically to a subfolder like /build/python

list of potentially useful funcs to wrap:
    com_printf prints to console

add return values to startscript and stopscript to echo some feedback in the console
