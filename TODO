ideas: ultimate hodor bot
       parameter optimizing strafebot

auto copy over python files, including a folder structure

fix importing scripts_record_playback, crashes q3

automate load / deployment / launch engine

figure out how to do hotswapping python code without restarting engine /reloadpython cmd maybe

record inputs from demoes for playback -> look into saving / writing playerstate in snapshot / clientsnapshot

list of potentially useful funcs to wrap:
    com_printf prints to console

allow *args in startscript, and inform user of invalid arguments

make usercmd record and replay work with delta angles
