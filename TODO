ideas: ultimate hodor bot
       parameter optimizing strafebot

record inputs from demoes for playback -> look into saving / writing playerstate in snapshot / clientsnapshot
apparently ps.stats[13] will show keypresses or usercmd stuff from in demoes, investigate other demo stuff

auto copy over python files, including a folder structure
automate load / deployment / launch engine

fix small 0.005 ish angle offset that happens with current conversion setup
(probably have to revert to using usercmd.angles, except without ever converting them
probably need some internal conversion function which IS symmetric?

for xpc solve   f(x) = -c * sin(a + b - 2 x) + w * sin(b - x) = 0 -> need solver
