PORT TO QUAKE3E engine instead of iodfcrap

demo list in ui is empty (playing and recording demoes works tho) seems like this iodfengine version is just crap

idea: ultimate hodor bot

automate load / deployment / launch engine

figure out how to do hotswapping python code without restarting engine /reloadpython cmd maybe

record inputs from demoes for playback -> look into saving / writing playerstate in snapshot / clientsnapshot

makefile fixes
    sdl264.dll does not get copied automatically anymore?
    sync entire python folder automatically to a subfolder like /build/python

list of potentially useful funcs to wrap:
    com_printf prints to console

FIX DEMOES NOT SAVING PROPERLY

continue to expose playerstate_t (bit of a chore tho)

add return values to startscript and stopscript to echo some feedback in the console
-> also use this to catch and inform user of wrong args / script names

make usercmd record and replay work with delta angles
FIX DELTA ANGLE ISSUE
