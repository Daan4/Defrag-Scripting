Building on Windows using Windows Subsystem for Linux
1) Install Ubuntu 18.04 from Microsoft Store
2) Run Ubuntu and update + install the following packages
    - sudo apt update
    - sudo apt dist-upgrade
    - sudo apt install make
    - sudo apt install bison
    - sudo apt install libc6-dev-i386
    - sudo apt install gcc-mingw-w64

3) cd to the iodfe source folder. For example:
    cd /mnt/d/Libraries/Documents/pycharmprojects/Defrag-Scripting/Quake3e-2019-11-29

4) make (make sure the python include path points to your windows installation of python, escaping spaces with \) (it will end with release failed due to python files but it works
    make PLATFORM="mingw32" CC="x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc" ARCH="x86_64" PYTHON="/mnt/d/Program\ Files/Python/Python38" CLIENT_EXTRA_FILES="../python/callbacks.py ../python/constants.py ../python/handles.py ../python/helpers.py ../python/scripts.py ../python/structs.py ../python/scripts_record_playback.py ../python/g.py"

5) after building create a shortcut with a target like this (for example)
D:\Libraries\Documents\pycharmprojects\Defrag-Scripting\Quake3e-2019-11-29\build\release-mingw32-x86_64\quake3e.x64.exe +set fs_game defrag +set vm_cgame 2 +set df_gametype 5 +set pmove_fixed 1 +set pmove_msec 8+set g_synchronousclients 0 +vq3 nicewalk-nowall

Notes:
    If there's an error related to "VersionHelpers.h" , find and replace each occurrence with "versionhelpers.h"
